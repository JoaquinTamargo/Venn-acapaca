## About

Venn acapacá is an adaptation of Venny Venny app. The aim of Venn acapacá was initially to perform an independent lookup through Shiny tools at Bioinformatics and Genomic Analysis subject at Universidad de Sevilla (Seville, Spain) Biochemistry Degree. Apart from the educational objectives, Venn acapacá was designed to be an user-friendly web-based tool to visualize Venn diagrams. This tool has been tested with a diferentially expressed genes list obtained from RNA-seq analysis, but may be useful with practically any two lists you need to examine.
